## 1. Use the data on the Costs worksheet of Chpt 10â€“1.xls, and replicate the calculations in Figure 10.3.
$$SS_T=\sum_{j=1}^{m}\sum_{i=1}^{n_j}(x_{ij}-\overline{\overline{x_j}})^{2}$$

a. Use a pivot table and the formula in Equation 10.1 to calculate the between group sum of squares (SSB) for the costs in the four hospitals.

b. Use the results of the pivot table from (a) and the formula in Equation 10.2 to calculate the within groups sum of squares (SSW) for the costs in the four hospitals.

c. Use the formula in Equation 10.3 to calculate the total sum of squares (SST) for the costs in the four hospitals.

d. Determine the appropriate degrees of freedom, and use the formula in Equation 10.4 to calculate the F value for a test of the null hypothesis that the mean costs in the four hospitals are all the same.

e. Use the =FDIST() function to obtain the probability of the F value, and draw the appropriate conclusion in regard to the null hypothesis
$$F= \frac{MS_B}{MS_W}$$
